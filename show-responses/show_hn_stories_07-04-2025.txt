        "description": "Hello HN,<p>We come from the TypeScript ecosystem, and over the years, we&#x27;ve extensively utilized TSOA.<p>Recently, while working on some projects in Go, we noticed the absence of a similar framework. So, we decided to create one ourselves.<p>Even though Go&#x27;s simple and standard library-first approach is great, there&#x27;s still room for an all-in-one API framework.<p>Thus, inspired by the TSOA project and its flexibility, we created Gleece, an open-source Go framework that simplifies the process of building, documenting, and maintaining RESTful APIs.<p>Features include:<p>Code-First - Define and document your API endpoints in code, making them easy to maintain and understand.<p>Self-Documenting - Automatically generate OpenAPI 3.0&#x2F;3.1 specifications from your code, ensuring your API is always well-documented and up-to-date.<p>Plug &amp; Play - Easy to get started with and &quot;plays nice&quot; with other frameworks, routers, and tools.<p>Customizable - A template-centric approach allows for easy yet extensive customization.<p>Holistic - Built-in support for authentication, authorization, request&#x2F;response validation, and error handling to help you create robust APIs.<p>IDE Integration - The project includes an optional Visual Studio Code extension to provide developers with quality-of-life features.<p>You can check out the project on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gopher-fleece&#x2F;gleece\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gopher-fleece&#x2F;gleece</a><p>and the documentation at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gleece.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gleece.dev&#x2F;</a><p>Thanks,<p>Haim &amp; Yuval",

        "description": "Hey HN, for the past 1.5 years my cofounder Antoine and I have been building Disco, an Open Source deployment platform that lets you host multiple web apps on a single server: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disco.cloud&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disco.cloud&#x2F;</a><p>After getting tired of high per-project pricing on platforms like Heroku and Render, and frustrated with Kubernetes&#x27; complexity, we created a platform with all the polish and convenience of commercial solutions, but as an Open Source project you can run anywhere. Disco gives you a streamlined experience (ie a clean CLI and web UI) with the freedom and economics of self-hosting.<p>Key features:<p>- Deploy from GitHub with fast deployment times - from git push to being live, our main static site deploys in 2 seconds (really); a medium sized Django app deploys in ~25 seconds<p>- Host multiple projects on a single server, cutting costs by 50%+ compared to per-project pricing<p>- Works with Node, Rust, Python, Django, Rails, static sites, and more<p>- Includes &quot;good enough&quot; Postgres for projects that don&#x27;t need enterprise features<p>- API keys for team access instead of SSH key management<p>- Run on your own infrastructure - from cloud VMs to Raspberry Pis to on-prem<p>- Built-in horizontal scaling - add servers to distribute the load and increase capacity<p>- Optionally, let us manage the infra for you: same Open Source stack, but less to worry about<p>A real-world example: We moved idealist.org &#x27;s staging environments, a highly trafficked site, from Heroku to Disco on a single $50&#x2F;month server, which now hosts 6 staging environments. On Heroku, each would have cost $500&#x2F;month ($3k total). We also moved all of Idealist&#x27;s production frontend SSR rendering to Disco, getting better stability at 1&#x2F;5th of the cost.<p>I personally moved a number of my hobby sites to a Raspberry Pi that sits at home, saving me hundreds for apps that used to be at Heroku and Render. See my (unhinged) Localhost talk at the Recurse Center about this - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=z2lP7C8VT6M\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=z2lP7C8VT6M</a><p>Speaking of Recurse, we host a &quot;community&quot; Disco installation there i.e. a shared 8Gb Raspberry Pi that&#x27;s hosting 52 (static&#x2F;backend&#x2F;go&#x2F;python&#x2F;rust, etc.) web projects at the time of this writing. That&#x27;s also a fun use case!<p>TLDR: Disco is perfect for both DIY self-hosters and teams looking for a more cost-effective deployment platform. Available now for self-hosting (free and Open Source) or as a managed service.<p>Try it out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disco.cloud&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disco.cloud&#x2F;</a> and let us know what you think here or on our Discord.

        "description": "Hey HN,<p>This is my first post on HackerNews ever, and honestly I\u2019ve been contemplating for a long while whether to post this. Usually, the quality of the things that people present here is very high (as is the level of discussion) and I became very self-conscious about the value of my work, but here goes nothing.<p>After submitting thousands of CVs in the recent months and getting an automatic rejection in 99% of the cases, I thought why not create a tool that will give me at least some direction where I can improve my CV and estimate how well I fit the criteria of a given job offer. The result of this is the app that I called reqmatch. This is the first time I dabbled in web development, as my expertise lies in iOS Development, but I am very much open to criticism, and what HNs general thoughts about this project are. If you want to see me using it, you can watch a short video that I posted here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;activity-7314927920626466816-rgGV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACylIQUBIV31NAcujp1ZtUAZ-y3hiQM5hxY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;activity-7314927920626466816-...</a>, but the general premise of the app is very simple and I encourage you to try it :)",

        "username": "rocksalad",

        "description": "Hey, I used to believe growing my freelance business meant hiring more people. Honestly, managing a team wasn&#x27;t appealing to me, I preferred working directly with clients and ensuring every project was up to my standards. Freelancers were sometimes unreliable; deadlines were missed, quality fluctuated, and communication was inconsistent. Clients noticed this too, often expressing frustration with unpredictability and varied results.<p>Tracking hours was another headache. Every client seemed to have their own unique expectations for reporting hours and billing. I spent hours every week just managing time logs and invoices, leaving less time for actual development work and personal life. It was exhausting and draining my enthusiasm for the work I once loved.<p>So, instead of scaling up traditionally, I launched Avastu.dev, a subscription-based development service I run entirely on my own. This transformed not only my business but significantly improved the quality of my life.<p>Here&#x27;s exactly how it changed things for me:<p>- 48-hour average project turnaround: No more juggling multiple freelancers&#x27; schedules or missed deadlines. My clients appreciate fast, predictable results.<p>- 90% client retention rate: Delivering consistent quality built trust and repeat business. My clients now know exactly what they&#x27;re getting, every single month.<p>- Eliminated hourly tracking and billing headaches: With a flat monthly fee, tracking hours became irrelevant. Clients get unlimited development tasks, removing uncertainty and simplifying billing entirely.<p>- Improved work-life balance: I can now focus fully on my work without distraction or administrative burdens. I\u2019ve regained personal time and enjoy my work more than ever.<p>Avastu.dev clearly defines the services offered, from frontend and backend development to WordPress, UX&#x2F;UI design, and AI integrations. This clarity helps clients quickly understand the value they&#x27;re getting.<p>Running Avastu.dev as a subscription service brought back my passion for development and significantly improved both client satisfaction and my own quality of life.<p>You can see exactly how it works at Avastu.dev. It might just transform your approach to development",

I wanted to do a similar project to send my band mates a lot of videos of our shows (more than 8 GB) and I did this project called Hyperspace and these dudes came with some ideas on how to improve the UI and experience overall.<p>So what&#x27;s interesting about this project is that I tried to do it as simple as ever. I used Go + HTMX, I tried to remove everything that was unnecessary, I also added a cool 2FA for connecting to another peer.<p>The flow is very simple. You create a session which is purely made out of words. \nOnce the other peer wants to connect the app generated a pin which should be shared back with the one that started the session, and boom you are instantly connected and can share ONLY ONE file at the time.<p>There are a some stuff that I want to improve later obviously, but I just want to put the project out there.",

        "description": "Hi HN!<p>After a year of building solo\u2014balancing late nights, a demanding day job, family commitments, and countless cups of coffee - I\u2019m excited (and relieved!) to announce the beta launch of EduVibz.<p>EduVibz transforms traditional curriculum topics into catchy, educational songs to help students learn more easily and effectively. I&#x27;ve started lean by covering three subjects from the South African CAPS Grade 12 curriculum, with additional Grade 12 and Grade 8 subjects already created and soon to be uploaded. The intention behind this initial release is to gather user feedback to refine both the music and the content, ensuring it\u2019s genuinely impactful before expanding to more grades and other curricula.<p>Part of the reason it took this long was securing a provisional patent, given that (to my knowledge) this is the first platform of its kind to attempt delivering curriculum-aligned educational songs at scale, while keeping content accurate, relevant, and continually updated.<p>I\u2019ve learned a lot building this so far, made my fair share of mistakes, and recognize that I probably could\u2019ve launched leaner. But I&#x27;m committed to improving and learning as I go.<p>You can check it out at www.eduvibz.com. Please note: a quick, free signup (just name, email, and password) is required to access the music library due to our streaming setup.<p>I&#x27;d greatly appreciate any feedback on the concept, the songs, the UX&#x2F;UI, or anything else you feel could help EduVibz become better and more impactful. If you&#x27;re passionate about EdTech or have experience scaling early-stage educational products, your insights would be particularly invaluable.<p>Thanks so much for taking a look. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

It takes public GitHub contribution stats (like commit counts, streaks, activity levels) and uses them to simulate a retro arcade-style battle between two profiles.<p>You can enter your GitHub username and challenge a friend or colleague, try the online matchmaking, or pick one of the pre-loaded profiles as an opponent. After the battle, it shows a breakdown of the stats used.<p>It started as a fun side-project to visualize GitHub activity in a different way.<p>You can play it live here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epicdevbattlesofhistory.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epicdevbattlesofhistory.com</a><p>It&#x27;s currently a closed-source project.

Show me a Movie is one of them! The current state of the app is the same as of 3 years ago. Besides getting it to work in the browser, minor bug fixes has been fixed.<p>With that said, go ahead and try it out. It is totally free, I only track page count using GoatCounter (for the fun of it).

It was also sometimes painful to create a test page specifically for non-tech users to consume an API. I originally vibe-coded this over a weekend just to make it easier for myself to debug API requests shared as curl commands. It slowly grew into something I found surprisingly useful in my workflow, so I decided to clean it up and share it.<p>uncurl.dev takes a curl command and:\n- Converts it into a visual representation\n- Lets you edit and inspect all parts of the request\n- Allows sharing via a unique link\n- (Optionally) executes it from the server, so business or non-technical users can see results<p>Execution is currently behind login, with a cap (5&#x2F;min) to avoid abuse and manage costs. Non-logged-in users can still build and share curl commands\u2014they just can\u2019t execute them. The server runs each request in a Docker sandbox with strict resource&#x2F;time limits (cpu, memory, timeout, no network access outside the request).<p>It\u2019s not meant to replace full-featured tools like Postman or Hoppscotch. It\u2019s more of a \u201cCLI-to-UI bridge\u201d for fast sharing and debugging, especially in dev workflows where curl is the starting point. Think of it like Pastebin or JSFiddle, but for curl commands.<p>If you\u2019ve ever copied a curl from an API doc and wanted a cleaner way to see it or send it to someone else, I\u2019d love your feedback.<p>Thanks!\n(You can try it without signup here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncurl.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncurl.dev</a>)",

        "description": "Greetings!<p>My wife and I built a collaborative platform for reusable checklists.<p>Users can share templates of checklists with few select users or everyone, copy templates of other users (like forking a repository on github), submit suggestions for checklists (like opening a PR on github).<p>I&#x27;ve got the idea after reading Atul Gawande&#x27;s &#x27;Checklist Manifesto&#x27; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Checklist_Manifesto\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Checklist_Manifesto</a>). Plus I kept forgetting things when going to the office, gym or traveling.<p>We&#x27;ve tried a few other checklist apps, like Microsoft To Do. But they all seem more geared towards one-off lists or lists that repeat on schedule. Plus web versions and collaborative features always felt like an afterthought.<p>Wiederhol is free for private use.<p>iOS users can install our app via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;app&#x2F;wiederhol&#x2F;id6739186169\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;app&#x2F;wiederhol&#x2F;id6739186169</a>.\nAndroid users can install <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiederhol.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiederhol.com&#x2F;</a> as a PWA (Progressive Web Application).<p>Tech stack: Ruby on Rails, React, PostgreSQL, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dokku.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dokku.com&#x2F;</a> for hosting on Hetzner, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pwabuilder.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pwabuilder.com</a> for the iOS app.<p>PS: Wiederhol means &#x27;repeat&#x27; (imperative verb form) in German.",

That&#x27;s like 90% less from AWS ec2 instance of same specs.<p>How shellmates works:<p><pre><code>    1. Rent a powerful bare metal server from providers like Hetzner or OVH at prices starting from $34.50&#x2F;month\n    2. We help you setup Firecracker VMs to divide your server into smaller VMs\n    3. Keep what you need and rent out the rest to other developers at fair prices\n    4. Save up to 90% compared to cloud providers like AWS while building relationships with other developers\n</code></pre>\nSo I&#x27;m eating my own dogfood with:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shellmates.andrewarrow.dev&#x2F;spots&#x2F;c8f3c470-f353-4804-bd5c-a5c30bba7dbb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shellmates.andrewarrow.dev&#x2F;spots&#x2F;c8f3c470-f353-4804-...</a><p>Looking for someone to share the cost with me.

I got the idea after noticing how tricky it can be to find styles that truly suit your unique features, and I wanted to make that process easier and more data-driven.<p>The tool uses computer vision to analyze facial features and classify face shapes, then matches them with style suggestions based on some geometric and aesthetic principles I researched. Building the AI model was a fun challenge\u2014training it to accurately detect face shapes while keeping it lightweight for quick results took a lot of iteration. I also worked on making the recommendations practical and user-friendly.<p>I\u2019d love to get your feedback! What do you think about using AI for this kind of personalization? Are there other features or use cases you\u2019d find interesting? If you\u2019ve worked on similar computer vision projects, I\u2019d be curious to hear about your experiences too.<p>Looking forward to your thoughts!",

The core idea was to offer a straightforward and competitively priced option for developers who need reliable PostgreSQL without overly complex configurations, leveraging the performance benefits of running directly on bare metal.<p>It runs on our global bare metal infrastructure. Key features we&#x27;ve implemented include:<p>* Built-in monitoring &amp; connection pooling<p>* IP Address Whitelisting (Trusted Sources)<p>* Automated backups configured directly to <i>your own</i> S3 bucket (giving you control over storage and potentially costs)<p>* An optional integration with Supabase, allowing you to use parts of their dashboard for enhanced usability with your database.<p>Under the hood, it&#x27;s built on Kubernetes running on our bare metal servers, using the CloudNativePG operator to manage the PostgreSQL instances. We&#x27;ve found this operator approach works well for handling stateful database workloads in K8s, challenging the old notion that databases don&#x27;t belong there.<p>The service stemmed from internal needs and early interest gathered from a waitlist (~300 signups). It&#x27;s currently live and available for use.<p>We&#x27;re launching it here on HN because we&#x27;d genuinely appreciate your feedback on:<p>* The overall developer experience and UI simplicity.<p>* The current feature set (especially the S3 backup and Supabase integration).<p>* Performance perceptions (given the bare metal base).<p>* Our pricing model&#x27;s competitiveness and clarity.<p>* Any technical aspects of the implementation (running PG on K8s&#x2F;bare metal).<p>Happy to answer any questions you have!<p>You can check out the product page here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latitude.sh&#x2F;databases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latitude.sh&#x2F;databases</a><p>Thanks for looking!",

        "description": "Hi HN,<p>YC w24 company here. We just pivoted from drone delivery and on-demand GPU rental back to our original idea - using AI for language learning.<p>The Sayso app uses interactive Stories, <i>really</i> good AI Phone Calls and immersive community posts to create a fantastic Spanish learning experience.<p>Sayso lets you \u201cshop around\u201d for the lesson&#x2F;story you want to do. Each story contains - well - a fun story that lets you see Spanish used in real world contexts, has you say a few useful sentences out loud so you practice pronunciation and ends with a short phone call that puts you on the spot. At the end, new words are added to an FSRS5-powered flashcard stack (most efficient memorization algorithm). I can tell you, it\u2019s a lot of fun, words just stick and you gain a lot of knowledge quickly.<p>Stories and phone calls are made to be fun and useful. E.g., instead of \u201chow to order a coffee\u201d, we do something like \u201ca waiter spills coffee on you\u201d - you can choose to be nice or yell at him. This way, phrases just stick really well.<p>There are also community posts, which are short videos in or about Spanish with a short exercise that lets you say a sentence out loud in the end. And there are phone call scenarios that are a bit longer.<p>As additional motivation, there are Amazon gift vouchers for the leaderboard toppers every week!<p>How did we get here?\nWe were part of YC w24. We applied to YC with AI language learning initially but decided to work on drone delivery during YC given our ML &amp; engineering backgrounds. Turns out, no one needs that and the unit economics simply don\u2019t work out. Then we launched gpudeploy.com and got #1 on HN [<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40260259\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40260259</a>]! But this didn&#x27;t work out either - we turned into glorified car (Nvidia GPU) salesmen which we were not good at. So we went back to our original idea, language learning. We launched an initial app last year and now took the learnings and recently launched SAYSO.<p>It is available on iOS only for now.<p>Enjoy and have a nice rest of the weekend!",

        "description": "During my last semester break, I got obsessed with calorie tracking and ended up juggling multiple apps to keep tabs on my intake. Each app had its killer feature that I couldn\u2019t get enough of, and I started dreaming of a single app that could bring all those standout tools together. So, I pinged my friend, and we decided to take a crack at building it ourselves. What I thought would be a quick weekend side project spiraled into an epic adventure.<p>I built this app using Flutter and Supabase as the main frontend and backend. I also used Swift for some components, such as the camera and widgets, for a better native experience.<p>I included all the features that I liked from the different apps I used.<p>A reliable database: We obtain food data from a comprehensive, high-quality database. This database primarily includes Western and European foods and information from package labels. We will soon add data from additional countries.<p>AI photo logging: Click a photo of your meal and get the estimates for calories and other macros. It&#x27;s pretty handy when at a restaurant where the nutritional values of food are not listed.<p>AI meal description: If you forgot to take a picture before eating, describe what you ate afterward to log it. Works similarly to food logging.<p>Barcode scanning: The feature is very quick and snappy, retrieving data from a vast open-source database.<p>Progress tracking: Uses intuitive graphs to track your steps, weight, and daily macros intake.<p>No ads and Privacy focused: Users can sign in with Apple to protect their privacy. No ads.<p>Integration with Apple: The app has dynamic widgets and integrates with the Apple Health app.<p>The next feature I&#x27;m working on is a dynamic nutrition coach that calculates goals based on the user&#x27;s personal progress, i.e., instead of a general formula for all users, it dynamically changes from user to user weekly, guiding the user like a personal coach.",

If you love the keyboard, minimalism, and staying in the flow \u2014 this tool is for you.<p>How It\u2019s Different?<p>Unlike other note-taking tools or wrappers around Apple Notes, memo is built specifically for terminal-first users who want tight, native integration with macOS without relying on sync services or third-party platforms. It uses Python to directly access the native Notes database on your Mac, meaning you don\u2019t have to leave your terminal \u2014 and your notes stay local, fast, and secure.<p>It\u2019s not trying to replace full-fledged note apps, but rather to complement your workflow if you live in the shell and want a lightweight, scriptable, and distraction-free way to interact with your Apple Notes.",

While the mobile experience needs work, I have used it for when I\u2019m traveling and it still does the job.<p>I\u2019m putting it out there in case anyone else might find value in it. I\u2019d welcome your ideas or feedback. I don\u2019t have plans to monetize it - that\u2019s not my goal - nor do I want to put other paid apps out of business.

It is not for everyone though as questions don&#x27;t always bring pleasure.<p>I wrote about why I built it here : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiantinker.bearblog.dev&#x2F;iwonderwhy-thoughts-around-making-an-ai-socratic-questioner&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiantinker.bearblog.dev&#x2F;iwonderwhy-thoughts-around...</a><p>Try it here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iwonderwhy.xyz&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iwonderwhy.xyz&#x2F;</a><p>Thanks.",

It reads tasks given by the user in natural language, uses gemini to generate commands to carry out the task, then gets executed as user proceeds.<p>Problems faced:\n1. It didn&#x27;t have context about the system&#x2F;file-folder structures. So had to implement the indexing. Though it doesn&#x27;t do the work fully rn.\n2. Improper commands. Sometimes it generates commands that don&#x27;t make sense. It can be tackled with search through predefined commands and feeding to the AI I guess.\n3. Combining all this, I want to make it more intelligent so it can take actions even with vague commands.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it works well with macos&#x2F;linux. Please let me know. I&#x27;ll continue this project. And give a star :)",

It was my very first Swift project when I bought my MacBook Pro in late 2021, and it helped me learn so much detail about how Apple platform development works. I&#x27;ve since written a few other apps, like a darkroom timer for when I was developing my own film and prints.<p>I welcome any and all issues and pull requests, and any constructive criticism of the project. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some old code hidden away somewhere that I can&#x27;t see it, or I wrote some of the code in a very inefficient way, and some Swift wizard will come along and point out how I can make it faster.<p>Thanks!",

        "description": "Hi there! I&#x27;ve created ApplyNinja, a platform that uses AI to help jobseekers apply to jobs faster and better.<p>What differentiates ApplyNinja from the other &quot;auto-apply&quot; platforms is the trained AI model behind it. It learns from your resume and the jobs you apply to, and it provides better and better results.<p>Currently, it serves as a helper for the entire application process:\n- Track &amp; Monitor job applications\n- Generates Resume suggestions and highlights the parts that are not so good\n- Auto-fixes and generates a new resume based on the suggestions\n- Creates Cover Letters based on your resume and the job description\n- Generates Company Insights, scraping user reviews from Glassdoor, Indeed etc.\n- Generates Salary Insights so jobseekers have a negotiation leverage\n- Generates Technical Interview Questions based on the Job Description<p>On top of all of this, it provides a gamified experience, because consistency is the key in applying to jobs.<p>Me and my friends are using it daily and manage to land approximately 5-10 interviews&#x2F;month as Software Engineers.<p>I would really love any kind of feedback. Thank you very much!",

        "description": "Hi HN,<p>I teach tech design history, and one of the key stories I cover is the development of the original iPhone keyboard by Ken Kocienda. Reading about it in his book &quot;Creative Selection&quot; is great, but I wanted my students (and now you!) to actually <i>feel</i> this step in the process.<p>So, I built a web simulator of the &quot;Blob Keyboard&quot;, Kocienda&#x27;s very first attempt at a touchscreen keyboard that actually works, from September 2005:<p>Try the Blob Keyboard: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juliendorra.github.io&#x2F;blob-keyboard-simulator&#x2F;blob-keyboard-simulator.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juliendorra.github.io&#x2F;blob-keyboard-simulator&#x2F;blob-k...</a><p>- Tap for the middle letter<p>- Swipe left or right for the side letters<p>More on the github repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;juliendorra&#x2F;blob-keyboard-simulator\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;juliendorra&#x2F;blob-keyboard-simulator</a><p>The Blob Keyboard prototype emerged during a UX crisis for iPhone team (their software keyboard just didn&#x27;t work at all, fingers being too big, and the Newton failure loomed over them), highlighting how innovation is rarely a straight path. It was developed on a tethered touchscreen display codenamed &quot;Wallaby&quot;.<p>To make this simulator as authentic as possible, I referenced images from Kocienda&#x27;s book and even got direct feedback and guidance from Ken Kocienda himself on Bluesky.<p>What to expect (or\u2026 what not to expect):<p>This is a reconstruction of a very early prototype with limitations reflecting that specific moment. The goal was to test first if typing with accuracy was even possible, as all the rest was moot if it failed!<p>It&#x27;s NOT QWERTY: They were still hoping to get us out of QWERTY, but then familiarity won.<p>No Backspace: You can&#x27;t delete.<p>No Cursor Movement: The text field is just a simple display.<p>No Caps or Numbers: Only lowercase letters.<p>No Smooth Animations: Keys just &quot;pop&quot; instantly when pressed. Kocienda noted that your eye fills in the gaps, giving a sense of movement.<p>Best Experience:<p>While it works with a mouse&#x2F;trackpad on desktop, it&#x27;s designed for touchscreens to better replicate the original Wallaby hardware interaction. Use it on your phone!<p>This project aims to provide a tangible glimpse into a turning point moment in iPhone development and the iterative nature of design. It&#x27;s like stepping back in time and trying out that early demo on Kocienda&#x27;s desk.<p>I would love to hear your reactions and thoughts on experiencing this piece of UI history! What other significant prototype do you wish you could experience?",
