        "description": "Hi HN! I&#x27;ve created [UFreeTools](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ufreetools.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ufreetools.com&#x2F;</a>), a collection of developer utilities (60+ tools and growing) that&#x27;s completely free, ad-free, and runs entirely in the browser. No data leaves your device - everything is processed locally.<p>## Background<p>As a developer, I found myself constantly searching for simple utilities like JSON formatters, UUID generators, and color pickers. Most existing options were cluttered with ads, required sign-ups, or sent data to servers. I wanted clean, fast tools that respected privacy.<p>So I built UFreeTools as a modern SPA using Vue 3 and Vite with:<p>- 100% client-side processing for all tools\n- Progressive loading with dynamic imports (only load what you use)\n- Dark&#x2F;light theme support\n- Offline capability for most tools\n- Responsive design that works well on mobile<p>## Technical Details<p>Some of the more technically interesting implementations:<p>- *JWT Debugger*: Uses WebCrypto API for verification of all common algorithms\n- *Symmetric Encryption*: Implements AES-GCM&#x2F;CBC&#x2F;CTR with PBKDF2 key derivation\n- *Image Processing*: Uses Web Workers for non-blocking operations on large images<p>## Lessons Learned<p>The biggest challenges were:<p>1. *Performance optimization*: Some tools (like image processors) needed careful optimization to handle large files without freezing the UI\n2. *Browser API limitations*: Working around browser restrictions for certain crypto operations\n3. *Bundle size management*: Keeping the initial load small while supporting 60+ tools<p>## Future Plans<p>I&#x27;m planning to add:\n- Tool configurations sync via local storage\n- More specialized tools for developers based on feedback<p>I built it because I needed these tools myself, and I hope others find it useful.<p>I&#x27;d love your feedback, especially on UX, tool suggestions, or if you find any bugs!<p>[Try UFreeTools](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ufreetools.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ufreetools.com&#x2F;</a>)"

This version of the tool was in large part written by Gemini 2.5. The features like a clean ui for selecting files to copy, tracking the number of lines&#x2F;tokens as you select things -- they&#x27;re largely inspired by the frustrations I had with previous iterations that were rigid or not transparent.<p>My usual pattern when working with this tool is select the files with relevant context and then paste the results into an AI chatbot which outputs a bash script to create&#x2F;overwrite multiple files at once. It&#x27;s also useful for large documentation git repos, like Streamlit&#x27;s docs... copy the parts I want of their docs into the Gemini 1M token context window.<p>Additional features may come, but for now this is an MVP that I believe is worth sharing."

It\u2019s a personalized, vertical video feed of the best plays, buzzer-beaters, dunks, goals, and big moments, updated in real-time without the pressure of social media.<p>Why we built it:\nI love sports, but keeping up with everything happening is overwhelming and existing apps are slow and cluttered. I didn\u2019t want to scroll through noisy feeds or scrub through full games. I wanted just the best stuff, in a format that feels fast and fun \u2014 like how TikTok reimagined social.<p>What Snack Sports does:\n- Watch a vertical feed of real-time highlights\n- Personalized to your favorite teams, players, and sports\n- Super fast \u2014 swipe through the biggest plays as they happen \n- Tailored for sports highlights- toggle to switch from portrait to landscape view of a highlight or speed up&#x2F;slow down the highlight to optimize your viewing experience.\n- Interact with other sports fans<p>The goal is to make sports more accessible and snackable \u2014 whether you missed the game or just want to relive the top plays in a few seconds.<p>Right now, we have the rights to men\u2019s and women\u2019s March Madness highlights and we hope to soon expand to the MLB and NFL in the future. Download the app before the Final Four and Championship games this weekend to give it a go!<p>Our team would love your feedback, thoughts, or ideas for where to take it next!"

I launched it today and would love your feedback!<p>I found myself overwhelmed by algorithmic feeds on platforms like YouTube and X, losing focus on what truly mattered. I missed the days when I controlled my information diet. FeedWise is my solution: an RSS reader that puts you back in the driver\u2019s seat.<p>For those who still value the power of RSS, FeedWise lets you subscribe to any RSS feed (articles, podcasts, YouTube channels&#x2F;playlists, subreddits, newsletters, even Hacker News). You can easily search, filter, mark items as read&#x2F;unread, as well as mute feeds to temporarily hide distractions and catch up on your terms. It also includes a dark mode for comfortable reading, and device sync is included for everyone.<p>The mute feature has been a game-changer for me, letting me focus on what&#x27;s important without the anxiety of unsubscribing and potentially missing out later. It&#x27;s about reclaiming attention from the noise.<p>FeedWise started as a personal project to learn new tech stacks (I\u2019d rebuild it every year or so), but it became a tool that genuinely improved my life. Now I want to share it with others who feel overwhelmed by algorithmic feeds.<p>Questions or critiques are more than welcome.

        "description": "Definition Stack is a new vscode extension I have just released. It is a reading tool for Javascript and Typescript. It is available in the extension marketplace.<p>You just click in a function in any source code, execute a command, and a new tab opens next to the original. That tab has a &quot;block&quot; which contains a copy of the function you clicked in. In that code every word (symbol) that has a definition is highlighted.  If you click on a higlighted word a new block opens above the original which contains the source code of the definition for that word. You can click in that block and repeat to create a stack.  All function blocks are in the one tab that you can scroll through.<p>There are other options like collapsing a block, deleting it, etc. It is easy to open a block, look at it, and delete it taking you back to the block below. Then clicking in the lower block with another word opens yet another block above.  Continuining this process lets you walk the &quot;tree&quot; of references and definitions. This lets you see all the code executed when the original function runs. This is similar to stepping through code with a debugger.<p>The function code is isolated in each block with the name of the original source code file and the lines are numbered the same.  But when using the stack you can ignore what file each one came from. This gives a fresh way to look at what all the functions do without the cognitive load of remembering what file the functions are in.<p>AFAIK, this concept is original.  Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.  My idea came from an IDE for Java from IBM many years ago.  In that system there were no source files at all.  Each function came from from a database. That IDE was a failure :-)  I think my version of that concept will do better because it doesn&#x27;t replace source files, it just adds a tool for working with source files.  The stack is created instantly and is just meant to be used occasionally when it makes sense.  It is sort of a Go To Definition on steroids.<p>Please give me feedback.  Since it is brand new I want to fix anything wrong including user experience problems.  Enjoy ..."

        "url": null,
        "description": "Hello, Hackers!<p>I\u2019d like to share a pet project my teammate and I have been working on. The core idea is to build a multi-language computational graph that also lets you quickly deploy a mini-FaaS (Function as a Service) platform on your local machine. In other words, you can easily mix and match code from various sources (and even different third-party tools) using a local framework and server. We\u2019re calling this project SPL.<p>How did this idea come about?<p>While working on a complex model, we realized we needed to combine code and utilities written in different languages, pulled from earlier projects. We had separate DB-queries, several fundamentally different methods of preprocessing large datasets, a two-stage training process, plus final evaluation and validation of the resulting model.<p>We considered well-known tools like Airflow, Dagster, and Prefect. However, they felt a bit heavy for some simpler scenarios, and they weren\u2019t ideal for rapid prototyping. Besides, part of our dataset required lower-level processing with C++ rather than standard Python. That\u2019s how the idea for a pet project arose\u2014something that would let us seamlessly bring together code that otherwise wouldn\u2019t play nicely, and also allow us to share our work within the team. Essentially, we had a few key goals:<p>1. Build a connected computational graph made up of functions or utilities, regardless of their language or dependencies.<p>2. Support both local and remote execution of these graphs (so teams can share their work).<p>3. Make it possible to run only part of a graph, keeping the state and results of previous steps, to simplify testing new approaches.<p>Some implementation details<p>A computational graph is a directed, connected graph with nodes (functions or utilities) and links between them (inputs and outputs). Each node takes input parameters, performs a specific task, and sends the result along to the next node.<p>Our approach involves a framework for a specific language\u2014if we\u2019re running code\u2014plus a server that handles the FaaS side, orchestrates nodes in the graph, and takes care of passing artifacts around correctly.<p>We chose to build the first version of the SPL framework for Python, since that\u2019s the language we use most. The end result will be a library that lets you intuitively create computational graphs right from a Python notebook.<p>To manage the graph itself\u2014adding or removing nodes, saving results, and running only certain parts\u2014we decided on a mechanic similar to PyTorch. In PyTorch, you build a model by sequentially adding layers to `nn.Sequential()`.<p>A pocket-sized FaaS<p>One of the coolest features, in our opinion, is that you can quickly spin up your own mini-FaaS right on your machine. If your computer has internet access, your functions and graphs become instantly available to other users.<p>Right now, the SPL server supports:<p>-An HTTP API for remotely executing functions.<p>-Import and export of graphs in JSON format.<p>-Task coordination and distributed result caching.<p>-A simple web interface for viewing and editing graphs.<p>Possible use cases for SPL:\n1. Local development: Build graphs and functions you can reuse across different projects without constantly copying code.<p>2. Production usage: Keep business logic and infrastructure separate, with easy zero-downtime updates.<p>3. Personal FaaS (including a function marketplace): Potentially publish your work for others (including monetization), delivering only results instead of the entire codebase.<p>4. Visualizing business processes: The server supports graph rendering and displays input and output ports, which can be handy for high-level project management.<p>Why am I writing this post?<p>We\u2019d really love to hear what you think:<p>-Have you faced similar challenges?<p>-Would such a tool be useful for you?<p>-What features would you like to see in a project like this?<p>We\u2019re excited to discuss these ideas in the comments!"

This little side project got over &gt;150k installs (no joke!), but here\u2019s the thing: that\u2019s a vanity number. If one person installs it as an admin in a big org, boom \u2014 the number goes up. But the real insight? It came from the emails I received.<p>I got tons of messages from users asking about missing features, bugs, and the challenges of the Apps Script ecosystem. For example, there\u2019s the whole issue with not being able to set specific response codes. These were my real insights into the user base \u2014 and it made me realize that people are really just looking for a simple solution to log webhook data in the tools they already use.<p>People love simple solutions. They want to log webhook data to their tool of choice without paying $$$ to tools like Zapier or Make.com. So, I thought, why not build something that does just that?<p>And that&#x27;s how Hooksy was born!"

        "username": "abelanger",
        "url": "https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet",
        "description": "Hey HN - this is Alexander from Hatchet. We\u2019re building an open-source platform for managing background tasks, using Postgres as the underlying database.<p>Just over a year ago, we launched Hatchet as a distributed task queue built on top of Postgres with a 100% MIT license (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643136\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643136</a>). The feedback and response we got from the HN community was overwhelming. In the first month after launching, we processed about 20k tasks on the platform \u2014 today, we\u2019re processing over 20k tasks per minute (&gt;1 billion per month).<p>Scaling up this quickly was difficult \u2014 every task in Hatchet corresponds to at minimum 5 Postgres transactions and we would see bursts on Hatchet Cloud instances to over 5k tasks&#x2F;second, which corresponds to roughly 25k transactions&#x2F;second. As it turns out, a simple Postgres queue utilizing FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED doesn\u2019t cut it at this scale. After provisioning the largest instance type that CloudSQL offers, we even discussed potentially moving some load off of Postgres in favor of something trendy like Clickhouse + Kafka.<p>But we doubled down on Postgres, and spent about 6 months learning how to operate Postgres databases at scale and reading the Postgres manual and several other resources [0] during commutes and at night. We stuck with Postgres for two reasons:<p>1. We wanted to make Hatchet as portable and easy to administer as possible, and felt that implementing our own storage engine specifically on Hatchet Cloud would be disingenuous at best, and in the worst case, would take our focus away from the open source community.<p>2. More importantly, Postgres is general-purpose, which is what makes it both great but hard to scale for some types of workloads. This is also what allows us to offer a general-purpose orchestration platform \u2014 we heavily utilize Postgres features like transactions, SKIP LOCKED, recursive queries, triggers, COPY FROM, and much more.<p>Which brings us to today. We\u2019re announcing a full rewrite of the Hatchet engine \u2014 still built on Postgres \u2014 together with our task orchestration layer which is built on top of our underlying queue. To be more specific, we\u2019re launching:<p>1. DAG-based workflows that support a much wider array of conditions, including sleep conditions, event-based triggering, and conditional execution based on parent output data [1].<p>2. Durable execution \u2014 durable execution refers to a function\u2019s ability to recover from failure by caching intermediate results and automatically replaying them on a retry. We call a function with this ability a durable task. We also support durable sleep and durable events, which you can read more about here [2]<p>3. Queue features such as key-based concurrency queues (for implementing fair queueing), rate limiting, sticky assignment, and worker affinity.<p>4. Improved performance across every dimension we\u2019ve tested, which we attribute to six improvements to the Hatchet architecture: range-based partitioning of time series tables, hash-based partitioning of task events (for updating task statuses), separating our monitoring tables from our queue, buffered reads and writes, switching all high-volume tables to use identity columns, and aggressive use of Postgres triggers.<p>We&#x27;ve also removed RabbitMQ as a required dependency for self-hosting.<p>We&#x27;d greatly appreciate any feedback you have and hope you get the chance to try out Hatchet.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hatchet.run&#x2F;home&#x2F;conditional-workflows\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hatchet.run&#x2F;home&#x2F;conditional-workflows</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hatchet.run&#x2F;home&#x2F;durable-execution\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hatchet.run&#x2F;home&#x2F;durable-execution</a>"

But unfortunately are not compatible with traditional language learning apps (linq, language reactor, migaku, etc.) and manually looking up text disrupts the reading a lot.<p>So I made a little Chrome extension that runs OCR on the comics, translates them, and overlays popups on top of the speech bubbles to easily read them.<p>I also made a version that runs in the Kindle browser, by building a very optimized&#x2F;limited webpage that doesn&#x27;t crash the very-limited Kindle browser.<p>Maybe it can be useful to some here :)"

When my strain analysis (research) tool won 3rd place at Make OHI&#x2F;O, I decided to break that pattern.<p>During the actual 24-hour competition, I pushed beyond the usual expectation. I built a working app with full test coverage and deployed it live. But after everyone packed up and went home? That&#x27;s when the real work began.<p>I challenged myself to transform this quick hack into production-grade software. I built CI&#x2F;CD pipelines that automatically test and deploy. I published Docker images that run on both AMD64 (Intel) and ARM64 (Apple M1&#x2F;M2) architectures. I wrote the kind of documentation I always wish existed when I explore new projects.<p>What emerged isn&#x27;t just a tool for analyzing material deformation - it&#x27;s my personal blueprint for sustainable software development. Every automation pipeline, every README, every test represents a best practice I&#x27;ve learned and implemented over the years.<p>The repo stands as proof that hackathon projects don&#x27;t need to die after demo day.

        "url": "https://www.opennutrition.app/search",
        "description": "Hi HN!<p>Today I\u2019m excited to launch OpenNutrition: a free, ODbL-licenced nutrition database of everyday generic, branded, and restaurant foods, a search engine that can browse the web to import new foods, and a companion app that bundles the database and search as a free macro tracking app.<p>Consistently logging the foods you eat has been shown to support long-term health outcomes (1)(2), but doing so easily depends on having a large, accurate, and up-to-date nutrition database. Free, public databases are often out-of-date, hard to navigate, and missing critical coverage (like branded restaurant foods). User-generated databases can be unreliable or closed-source. Commercial databases come with ongoing, often per-seat licensing costs, and usage restrictions that limit innovation.<p>As an amateur powerlifter and long-term weight loss maintainer, helping others pursue their health goals is something I care about deeply. After exiting my previous startup last year, I wanted to investigate the possibility of using LLMs to create the database and infrastructure required to make a great food logging app that was cost engineered for free and accessible distribution, as I believe that the availability of these tools is a public good. That led to creating the dataset I\u2019m releasing today; nutritional data is public record, and its organization and dissemination should be, too.<p>What\u2019s in the database?<p>- 5,287 common everyday foods, 3,836 prepared and generic restaurant foods, and 4,182 distinct menu items from ~50 popular US restaurant chains; foods have standardized naming, consistent numeric serving sizes, estimated micronutrient profiles, descriptions, and citations&#x2F;groundings to USDA, AUSNUT, FRIDA, CNF, etc, when possible.<p>- 313,442 of the most popular US branded grocery products with standardized naming, parsed serving sizes, and additive&#x2F;allergen data, grounded in branded USDA data; the most popular 1% have estimated micronutrient data, with the goal of full coverage.<p>Even the largest commercial databases can be frustrating to work with when searching for foods or customizations without existing coverage. To solve this, I created a real-time version of the same approach used to build the core database that can browse the web to learn about new foods or food customizations if needed (e.g., a highly customized Starbucks order). There is a limited demo on the web, and in-app you can log foods with text search, via barcode scan, or by image, all of which can search the web to import foods for you if needed. Foods discovered via these searches are fed back into the database, and I plan to publish updated versions as coverage expands.<p>- Search &amp; Explore: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;search\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;search</a><p>- Methodology&#x2F;About: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;about</a><p>- Get the iOS App: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;opennutrition-macro-tracker&#x2F;id6670272666\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;opennutrition-macro-tracker&#x2F;id...</a><p>- Download the dataset: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;download</a><p>OpenNutrition\u2019s iOS app offers free essential logging and a limited number of agentic searches, plus expenditure tracking and ongoing diet recommendations like best-in-class paid apps.

You can also engage &quot;Bad Robot Mode&quot; and TAPOTRONBOT will be slightly disappointed and bored with you.<p>So you tap buttons and it will store your taps, best times, tap streak e t c. You choose a faction to join (I&#x27;m &quot;HARD G. GIF&quot; for life!) and your taps will contribute to your faction. You can also watch the global community&#x27;s taps count upwards live as other tappers tap.<p>Your taps will earn you achievements and you&#x27;ll unlock more visual themes as you tap along. If you tap every day your score multiplier will increase. The score multiplier is also based on you TPM (taps per minute).<p>And since it&#x27;s such a silly concept (tap a button!) I&#x27;ve doubled down on comparing it to Tetris, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Minecraft, Fortnite e t c. TAPOTRON has ambitions of a AAA title but on a AA battery budget.<p>App Store: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;6738282470\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;6738282470</a><p>Trailer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HZb_vG3nXao\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HZb_vG3nXao</a><p>Website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tapotron.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tapotron.com</a><p>It&#x27;s only for iOS at the moment since it started out as a silly side project, but quickly snowballed to what it is now. Would be fun to port it to Android later on.<p>Also note: It&#x27;s completely free to play and you can unlock stuff via progression. If you&#x27;re lazy (or just want to support TAPOTRON) you can also purchase an unlock.<p>But, idea is to have it completely free. No third party trackers and completely ad-free.<p>If you have any feedback or questions just shoot! Stack is SwiftUI, Firebase Realtime database, Firestore database, Telemetry Deck for analytics."

Instead of relying on GitHub&#x27;s deployment_status events, it actively polls Vercel&#x27;s API to ensure deployments are truly ready before running tests or other checks.<p>Key technical features:\n- Direct integration with Vercel&#x27;s API for real-time deployment status\n- Configurable polling with timeout and interval settings\n- Support for team projects and branch aliases\n- Works with both preview and production deployments\n- No special webhook configuration needed<p>The main advantage is reliability: Many CI pipelines fail intermittently because they start running tests before Vercel deployments are actually ready. Traditional solutions rely on GitHub&#x27;s deployment_status events, which can be unreliable or require complex setup.<p>This action solves that by:\n1. Retrieving the latest deployment for your project&#x2F;branch\n2. Extracting the preview&#x2F;production URL\n3. Actively polling until the deployment is genuinely ready<p>Example use cases:\n- Running E2E tests against preview deployments\n- Multi-app testing workflows\n- Post-production deployment validation\n- Accessibility testing on live environments<p>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RoyBkker&#x2F;github-action-vercel-preview-url-poller\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RoyBkker&#x2F;github-action-vercel-preview-url...</a><p>I&#x27;d love feedback from the HN community, especially from those dealing with similar CI&#x2F;CD challenges."

        "description": "Hello, this is Edgar! We are open sourcing nix-ninja, an incremental build system for Nix that leverages dynamic derivations.<p>For those unfamiliar, Nix is a powerful package manager and build system that ensures reproducible builds via strict dependency isolation. However, one of its limitations has been that it builds packages as monolithic units - if you change one source file, Nix rebuilds the entire package from scratch.<p>nix-ninja solves this by bringing compilation unit level granularity to Nix builds. It targets ninja build files, a format for describing build graphs output by popular build systems like CMake and meson. This means that when you modify a single source file, only the affected compilation units need to be rebuilt, significantly reducing build times.<p>We&#x27;re excited because this gives Nix fine-grained caching with early cutoff optimisation (see the Build Systems \u00e0 la Carte paper). Combined with remote build farms like Nixbuild.net, this moves Nix into the incremental cloud build systems arena, alongside Google&#x27;s Bazel and Meta&#x27;s Buck2.<p>Dynamic derivations and content-addressed derivations are still experimental features in Nix, so we&#x27;re hoping to accelerate their maturation by providing a compelling use-case and implementation. Our north star is to have Hydra (nixpkgs&#x27; CI runner) support incremental compilation in nixpkgs for slow builds like LLVM.<p>nix-ninja can compile Nix itself today, but we&#x27;re still very early in its development. Given community interest in dynamic derivations and incremental compilation in Nix, we decided to open source it in an pre-alpha state to involve the community in its design.<p>Please take a look. We&#x27;ll be available in the comments to answer any questions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pdtpartners&#x2F;nix-ninja\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pdtpartners&#x2F;nix-ninja</a>"

If I keep wanna &quot;vibing&quot;, I would just give it the screenshot of my current webpage view along with the console logs, and even network requests if its connected to some APIs<p>But even this took quite some manual effort and time, so I decided to solve this problem for myself when I created Composer Web (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;saketsarin&#x2F;composer-web)<p>It solves that problem seamlessly by sending all your logs, reqs, and screenshot of your webpage altogether directly to your cursor chat, in just one-click and LESS THAN A SECOND.<p>I made this open source and it kinda blew up.
