        "username": "abelanger",
        "url": "https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet",
        "description": "Hey HN - this is Alexander from Hatchet. We\u2019re building an open-source platform for managing background tasks, using Postgres as the underlying database.<p>Just over a year ago, we launched Hatchet as a distributed task queue built on top of Postgres with a 100% MIT license (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643136\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643136</a>). The feedback and response we got from the HN community was overwhelming. In the first month after launching, we processed about 20k tasks on the platform \u2014 today, we\u2019re processing over 20k tasks per minute (&gt;1 billion per month).<p>Scaling up this quickly was difficult \u2014 every task in Hatchet corresponds to at minimum 5 Postgres transactions and we would see bursts on Hatchet Cloud instances to over 5k tasks&#x2F;second, which corresponds to roughly 25k transactions&#x2F;second. As it turns out, a simple Postgres queue utilizing FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED doesn\u2019t cut it at this scale. After provisioning the largest instance type that CloudSQL offers, we even discussed potentially moving some load off of Postgres in favor of something trendy like Clickhouse + Kafka.<p>But we doubled down on Postgres, and spent about 6 months learning how to operate Postgres databases at scale and reading the Postgres manual and several other resources [0] during commutes and at night. We stuck with Postgres for two reasons:<p>1. We wanted to make Hatchet as portable and easy to administer as possible, and felt that implementing our own storage engine specifically on Hatchet Cloud would be disingenuous at best, and in the worst case, would take our focus away from the open source community.<p>2. More importantly, Postgres is general-purpose, which is what makes it both great but hard to scale for some types of workloads. This is also what allows us to offer a general-purpose orchestration platform \u2014 we heavily utilize Postgres features like transactions, SKIP LOCKED, recursive queries, triggers, COPY FROM, and much more.<p>Which brings us to today. We\u2019re announcing a full rewrite of the Hatchet engine \u2014 still built on Postgres \u2014 together with our task orchestration layer which is built on top of our underlying queue. To be more specific, we\u2019re launching:<p>1. DAG-based workflows that support a much wider array of conditions, including sleep conditions, event-based triggering, and conditional execution based on parent output data [1].<p>2. Durable execution \u2014 durable execution refers to a function\u2019s ability to recover from failure by caching intermediate results and automatically replaying them on a retry. We call a function with this ability a durable task. We also support durable sleep and durable events, which you can read more about here [2]<p>3. Queue features such as key-based concurrency queues (for implementing fair queueing), rate limiting, sticky assignment, and worker affinity.<p>4. Improved performance across every dimension we\u2019ve tested, which we attribute to six improvements to the Hatchet architecture: range-based partitioning of time series tables, hash-based partitioning of task events (for updating task statuses), separating our monitoring tables from our queue, buffered reads and writes, switching all high-volume tables to use identity columns, and aggressive use of Postgres triggers.<p>We&#x27;ve also removed RabbitMQ as a required dependency for self-hosting.<p>We&#x27;d greatly appreciate any feedback you have and hope you get the chance to try out Hatchet.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hatchet.run&#x2F;home&#x2F;conditional-workflows\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hatchet.run&#x2F;home&#x2F;conditional-workflows</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hatchet.run&#x2F;home&#x2F;durable-execution\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hatchet.run&#x2F;home&#x2F;durable-execution</a>"

        "description": "Hi HN!<p>Today I\u2019m excited to launch OpenNutrition: a free, ODbL-licenced nutrition database of everyday generic, branded, and restaurant foods, a search engine that can browse the web to import new foods, and a companion app that bundles the database and search as a free macro tracking app.<p>Consistently logging the foods you eat has been shown to support long-term health outcomes (1)(2), but doing so easily depends on having a large, accurate, and up-to-date nutrition database. Free, public databases are often out-of-date, hard to navigate, and missing critical coverage (like branded restaurant foods). User-generated databases can be unreliable or closed-source. Commercial databases come with ongoing, often per-seat licensing costs, and usage restrictions that limit innovation.<p>As an amateur powerlifter and long-term weight loss maintainer, helping others pursue their health goals is something I care about deeply. After exiting my previous startup last year, I wanted to investigate the possibility of using LLMs to create the database and infrastructure required to make a great food logging app that was cost engineered for free and accessible distribution, as I believe that the availability of these tools is a public good. That led to creating the dataset I\u2019m releasing today; nutritional data is public record, and its organization and dissemination should be, too.<p>What\u2019s in the database?<p>- 5,287 common everyday foods, 3,836 prepared and generic restaurant foods, and 4,182 distinct menu items from ~50 popular US restaurant chains; foods have standardized naming, consistent numeric serving sizes, estimated micronutrient profiles, descriptions, and citations&#x2F;groundings to USDA, AUSNUT, FRIDA, CNF, etc, when possible.<p>- 313,442 of the most popular US branded grocery products with standardized naming, parsed serving sizes, and additive&#x2F;allergen data, grounded in branded USDA data; the most popular 1% have estimated micronutrient data, with the goal of full coverage.<p>Even the largest commercial databases can be frustrating to work with when searching for foods or customizations without existing coverage. To solve this, I created a real-time version of the same approach used to build the core database that can browse the web to learn about new foods or food customizations if needed (e.g., a highly customized Starbucks order). There is a limited demo on the web, and in-app you can log foods with text search, via barcode scan, or by image, all of which can search the web to import foods for you if needed. Foods discovered via these searches are fed back into the database, and I plan to publish updated versions as coverage expands.<p>- Search &amp; Explore: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;search\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;search</a><p>- Methodology&#x2F;About: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;about</a><p>- Get the iOS App: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;opennutrition-macro-tracker&#x2F;id6670272666\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;opennutrition-macro-tracker&#x2F;id...</a><p>- Download the dataset: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opennutrition.app&#x2F;download</a><p>OpenNutrition\u2019s iOS app offers free essential logging and a limited number of agentic searches, plus expenditure tracking and ongoing diet recommendations like best-in-class paid apps.

        "description": "Definition Stack is a new vscode extension I have just released. It is a reading tool for Javascript and Typescript. It is available in the extension marketplace.<p>You just click in a function in any source code, execute a command, and a new tab opens next to the original. That tab has a &quot;block&quot; which contains a copy of the function you clicked in. In that code every word (symbol) that has a definition is highlighted.  If you click on a higlighted word a new block opens above the original which contains the source code of the definition for that word. You can click in that block and repeat to create a stack.  All function blocks are in the one tab that you can scroll through.<p>There are other options like collapsing a block, deleting it, etc. It is easy to open a block, look at it, and delete it taking you back to the block below. Then clicking in the lower block with another word opens yet another block above.  Continuining this process lets you walk the &quot;tree&quot; of references and definitions. This lets you see all the code executed when the original function runs. This is similar to stepping through code with a debugger.<p>The function code is isolated in each block with the name of the original source code file and the lines are numbered the same.  But when using the stack you can ignore what file each one came from. This gives a fresh way to look at what all the functions do without the cognitive load of remembering what file the functions are in.<p>AFAIK, this concept is original.  Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.  My idea came from an IDE for Java from IBM many years ago.  In that system there were no source files at all.  Each function came from from a database. That IDE was a failure :-)  I think my version of that concept will do better because it doesn&#x27;t replace source files, it just adds a tool for working with source files.  The stack is created instantly and is just meant to be used occasionally when it makes sense.  It is sort of a Go To Definition on steroids.<p>Please give me feedback.  Since it is brand new I want to fix anything wrong including user experience problems.  Enjoy ..."

        "username": "splimeproject",
        "url": null,
        "description": "Hello, Hackers!<p>I\u2019d like to share a pet project my teammate and I have been working on. The core idea is to build a multi-language computational graph that also lets you quickly deploy a mini-FaaS (Function as a Service) platform on your local machine. In other words, you can easily mix and match code from various sources (and even different third-party tools) using a local framework and server. We\u2019re calling this project SPL.<p>How did this idea come about?<p>While working on a complex model, we realized we needed to combine code and utilities written in different languages, pulled from earlier projects. We had separate DB-queries, several fundamentally different methods of preprocessing large datasets, a two-stage training process, plus final evaluation and validation of the resulting model.<p>We considered well-known tools like Airflow, Dagster, and Prefect. However, they felt a bit heavy for some simpler scenarios, and they weren\u2019t ideal for rapid prototyping. Besides, part of our dataset required lower-level processing with C++ rather than standard Python. That\u2019s how the idea for a pet project arose\u2014something that would let us seamlessly bring together code that otherwise wouldn\u2019t play nicely, and also allow us to share our work within the team. Essentially, we had a few key goals:<p>1. Build a connected computational graph made up of functions or utilities, regardless of their language or dependencies.<p>2. Support both local and remote execution of these graphs (so teams can share their work).<p>3. Make it possible to run only part of a graph, keeping the state and results of previous steps, to simplify testing new approaches.<p>Some implementation details<p>A computational graph is a directed, connected graph with nodes (functions or utilities) and links between them (inputs and outputs). Each node takes input parameters, performs a specific task, and sends the result along to the next node.<p>Our approach involves a framework for a specific language\u2014if we\u2019re running code\u2014plus a server that handles the FaaS side, orchestrates nodes in the graph, and takes care of passing artifacts around correctly.<p>We chose to build the first version of the SPL framework for Python, since that\u2019s the language we use most. The end result will be a library that lets you intuitively create computational graphs right from a Python notebook.<p>To manage the graph itself\u2014adding or removing nodes, saving results, and running only certain parts\u2014we decided on a mechanic similar to PyTorch. In PyTorch, you build a model by sequentially adding layers to `nn.Sequential()`.<p>A pocket-sized FaaS<p>One of the coolest features, in our opinion, is that you can quickly spin up your own mini-FaaS right on your machine. If your computer has internet access, your functions and graphs become instantly available to other users.<p>Right now, the SPL server supports:<p>-An HTTP API for remotely executing functions.<p>-Import and export of graphs in JSON format.<p>-Task coordination and distributed result caching.<p>-A simple web interface for viewing and editing graphs.<p>Possible use cases for SPL:\n1. Local development: Build graphs and functions you can reuse across different projects without constantly copying code.<p>2. Production usage: Keep business logic and infrastructure separate, with easy zero-downtime updates.<p>3. Personal FaaS (including a function marketplace): Potentially publish your work for others (including monetization), delivering only results instead of the entire codebase.<p>4. Visualizing business processes: The server supports graph rendering and displays input and output ports, which can be handy for high-level project management.<p>Why am I writing this post?<p>We\u2019d really love to hear what you think:<p>-Have you faced similar challenges?<p>-Would such a tool be useful for you?<p>-What features would you like to see in a project like this?<p>We\u2019re excited to discuss these ideas in the comments!"

        "description": "Hello, this is Edgar! We are open sourcing nix-ninja, an incremental build system for Nix that leverages dynamic derivations.<p>For those unfamiliar, Nix is a powerful package manager and build system that ensures reproducible builds via strict dependency isolation. However, one of its limitations has been that it builds packages as monolithic units - if you change one source file, Nix rebuilds the entire package from scratch.<p>nix-ninja solves this by bringing compilation unit level granularity to Nix builds. It targets ninja build files, a format for describing build graphs output by popular build systems like CMake and meson. This means that when you modify a single source file, only the affected compilation units need to be rebuilt, significantly reducing build times.<p>We&#x27;re excited because this gives Nix fine-grained caching with early cutoff optimisation (see the Build Systems \u00e0 la Carte paper). Combined with remote build farms like Nixbuild.net, this moves Nix into the incremental cloud build systems arena, alongside Google&#x27;s Bazel and Meta&#x27;s Buck2.<p>Dynamic derivations and content-addressed derivations are still experimental features in Nix, so we&#x27;re hoping to accelerate their maturation by providing a compelling use-case and implementation. Our north star is to have Hydra (nixpkgs&#x27; CI runner) support incremental compilation in nixpkgs for slow builds like LLVM.<p>nix-ninja can compile Nix itself today, but we&#x27;re still very early in its development. Given community interest in dynamic derivations and incremental compilation in Nix, we decided to open source it in an pre-alpha state to involve the community in its design.<p>Please take a look. We&#x27;ll be available in the comments to answer any questions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pdtpartners&#x2F;nix-ninja\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pdtpartners&#x2F;nix-ninja</a>"

        "description": "Over the last few years, I&#x27;ve needed an easy way to quickly serialise and deserialise various network protocols safely and efficiently. Most of the libraries that existed at the time were either quite heavy, had less than stellar performance, or were an abstraction level above what I was looking for.<p>I decided to put together my own class to do the job, starting with an easy, low-overhead way to move bytes in and out of arbitrary buffers. Along the way, it picked up useful bits and pieces, such as buffer structures and allocators that made the byte shuffling faster, often being able to do it with zero allocations and zero copies. Safety features came along to make sure that malicious packet data or mistakes in the code wouldn&#x27;t result in segfaults or vulnerabilities.<p>It&#x27;s become useful enough to me that I&#x27;ve packaged it up in its own standalone library on the chance that it might be useful to others. It has zero dependencies other than the standard library and has been designed for quick integration into any project within minutes, or seconds with a copy paste of the amalgamated header. It can be used in production code but it&#x27;s also ideal for for those that want to quickly hack away at binary data with minimal fuss."

In addition to what I hope is an intuitive UI&#x2F;UX, one of the unique things about ABAL is the way that pronunciations are customized to a user&#x27;s native and target languages.<p>Systems like IPA (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;International_Phonetic_Alphabe\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;International_Phonetic_Alphabe</a>...) don&#x27;t make pronunciation any easier to get right for a majority of - if not all - language learners. ABAL solves this by showing phonetic hints that are written in the user&#x27;s native language script and are meant to be pronounced in the native language&#x27;s voice.<p>The name All Books, All Languages is intentionally quixotic, as it serves to set the ambitious and unreachable goal of hosting all of humanity&#x27;s written works while making them available to all language learners and readers across the globe!<p>Today, it hosts a number of generated short stories categorized by subject and CEFR level. I&#x27;m currently working on supporting (private) self-uploaded files, and works in the public domain. Work is also going into adding support for more languages, while evaluating and optimizing for cross-language translations accuracy.<p>It currently supports 56 languages (including Klingon and Latin!) - which comes out to 3080 permutations - or 3080 unique user profiles as I like to think of it. Both the marketing and application sites are fully internationalized - even response messages in 4xx responses use i18n. Quite a bit of work went into automating the i18n diff generation system to make sure I can release UI&#x2F;UX changes quickly.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll find it useful if you&#x27;re learning a new language or need to practice one you already know.

While you can run the same LLM as someone else by downloading the weights, there\u2019s no \u201crepresentation\u201d of agents that allows you to re-create an instance of an agent across services.<p>Agent File (.af) is an open standard file format for serializing stateful agents. Originally designed for the Letta framework, .af is a human-readable representation of all the associated state of an agent to reproduce the exact behavior and memories.<p>To demonstrate .af, we also made a few example agents with download links to .af:<p>- MemGPT: An agent with memory management tools for infinite context, as described in the MemGPT paper \nDeep Research: A research agent with planning, search, and memory tools to enable writing deep research reports from iterative research<p>- Customer Support: A customer support agent that has dummy tools for handling order cancellations, looking up order status, and also memory<p>- Stateless Workflow: A stateless graph workflow agent (no memory and deterministic tool calling) that evaluates recruiting candidates and drafts emails<p>- Composio Tools: An example of an agent that uses a Composio tool to star a GitHub repository<p>We\u2019d love to hear what people think of the agent schema we chose and if we\u2019re missing anything (we included everything that we need from Letta, but there may be other features in other frameworks)."

        "description": "Hey HN!<p>We realised that LLMs are great at generating code for super popular libraries like React. But they kinda suck at using less popular&#x2F;newly released libraries, forcing us to stick to established tools and hindering innovation.<p>There is already a standard for creating documentation for LLMs (llmstxt.org), but in my experience the implementations have not been great so far. `llms.txt` works as a good index of the available pages, but in many cases they link to HTML pages. This is a waste for LLMs to parse through (For example, Hono&#x27;s [best practices](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hono.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;best-practices\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hono.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;best-practices</a>) page is ~37k tokens, while its core content as Markdown is only ~1k tokens)<p>To help with this, we built Atlas Docs, a service + MCP server that provides LLMs with clean, LLM-friendly documentation for various libraries.<p>On the backend, it scrapes pages from documentation sites, processes them into standardized, clean markdown, and stores them into a database. It uses existing `llms.txt`, standardizes links, and crucially, <i>generates a clean `llms.txt` index</i> if the library doesn&#x27;t provide one.<p>The MCP server exposes the processed documentation via the [Model Context Protocol](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelcontextprotocol.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelcontextprotocol.io&#x2F;</a>). This lets LLMs list search and query the docs and retrieve the relevant pages in clean Markdown format.<p>This gives LLMs the structured, concise context they need to generate better code and in our limited testing so far, it definitely improves success rate of working with less popular libraries.<p>If you\u2019re using LLMs for coding, give it a try! You can find instructions to install it with any client that supports MCPs (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Claude Desktop etc).<p>We&#x27;re actively adding more libraries. Let me know what you&#x27;d like to see supported!"

I missed the days when I controlled my information diet. FeedMe is my solution: an RSS reader that puts you back in the driver\u2019s seat.<p>For those who still value the power of RSS, FeedMe lets you subscribe to any RSS feed (articles, podcasts, YouTube channels&#x2F;playlists, subreddits, newsletters, even Hacker News). You can easily search, filter, mark items as read&#x2F;unread, as well as mute feeds to temporarily hide distractions and catch up on your terms. It also includes a dark mode for comfortable reading, and device sync is included for everyone.<p>The mute feature has been a game-changer for me, letting me focus on what&#x27;s important without the anxiety of unsubscribing and potentially missing out later. It&#x27;s about reclaiming attention from the noise.<p>FeedMe started as a personal project to learn new tech stacks (I\u2019d rebuild it every year or so), but it became a tool that genuinely improved my life. Now I want to share it with others who feel overwhelmed by algorithmic feeds.<p>Questions or critiques are more than welcome.

The key mechanic is a &quot;push&quot; feature where tokens can displace entire lines of other tokens if there&#x27;s an empty space at the end of the line. When opponent tokens are pushed, they become inactive for one turn. Capture occurs when tokens are surrounded on all four sides.<p>After analyzing gameplay data, I found Pressure has an average branching factor of 11.5, which is higher than Othello (10) and Checkers (2.8), though lower than Chess (35). Its game tree complexity is approximately 10^57, placing it remarkably close to Othello (10^58) and much higher than Checkers (10^40), despite the smaller board size.<p>The state space complexity appears to be in the range of 10^20, comparable to Checkers, which is notable given Pressure uses a 5\u00d75 grid versus Checkers&#x27; 8\u00d78 board. Chess and Othello have higher state spaces at 10^44 and 10^28 respectively.<p>What&#x27;s computationally interesting is how the push mechanic generates this complexity. About 27.5% of all moves involve pushing, which creates a multiplicative effect on the decision space. Each push can reposition multiple tokens simultaneously and create cascading positional consequences beyond what the compact board size would suggest.\nI&#x27;ve found the average game length is approximately 50 moves, similar to Othello (58) but shorter than Chess (70) and Checkers (70).<p>Let me know what do you think about the game."

But then came the ads. Not long after, she started getting eerily specific suggestions on other platforms. Things she hadn\u2019t searched for. Things that felt too close. Somewhere, her cycle had been turned into a data point.<p>That bothered me more than I can explain.<p>These apps promise helpful insights. But in return, they take so much. Your private health data, your habits, your patterns. And they sell or share it with third parties. Some even charge ridiculous monthly fees, only to flood the app with ads and tracking scripts.<p>That moment was the beginning of something for me.<p>I built Faye because I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how wrong this all felt.<p>Faye is a free menstrual cycle tracker built from the ground up with one thing in mind: you stay in control.<p>Your data stays on your device.<p>No accounts, no cloud sync, no background trackers.<p>No ads, ever.<p>You can export or delete your data whenever you want. No begging, no hoops.<p>There\u2019s a password lock option.<p>There\u2019s a discreet mode that makes the app look like a work productivity tool, just in case.<p>It\u2019s completely free, with no hidden costs.<p>It\u2019s not just an app. It\u2019s a quiet protest against how the system works.<p>But here\u2019s the part I didn\u2019t expect.<p>I shared it with a few people. Some friends. Some folks in tech. Some in health circles. Almost nobody responded. Not about the privacy. Not about the features. Not even about the idea. Some tried it, sure. But it was quiet. Too quiet.<p>And I started to wonder\u2026<p>Did I build something only we needed? Is this just a personal itch I scratched, or are there people out there who also want this\u2026really want this? People who care deeply about their data staying theirs - people tired of apps that exploit vulnerability for profit.<p>I sat with that silence longer than I expected.<p>It made me question everything. How we talk about privacy, who we build for, and whether anyone notices when something doesn\u2019t try to sell them something.<p>Because when you strip away the dark patterns and the dopamine loops, there\u2019s no reward system left. No notifications engineered to pull you back in. Just a quiet little app, trying to do the right thing.<p>And maybe that\u2019s the problem. Or maybe that\u2019s the point.<p>I still don\u2019t know.<p>I don\u2019t know if I built something only we needed.\nI don\u2019t know if people really want privacy.\nI don\u2019t know if \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d is enough to make something last.<p>What I do know is that I couldn\u2019t unsee what I saw. I couldn\u2019t forget that feeling, that jolt, when I realized how casually something so personal was being harvested and sold.<p>So I built the thing I couldn\u2019t find. I put it out there.<p>And I\u2019m sharing this, not as a launch or a pitch. Just as a note from someone who built something they believe in, and is now standing in the quiet, hoping it might matter to someone else too.<p>If that\u2019s you, I\u2019d really love to know. Even just a quick reply telling me you get it would mean a lot.<p>And if you think someone else in your life might care; a friend, a sister, a partner\u2026 maybe share Faye with them.<p>It\u2019s not a 100-million-dollar idea.\nBut it\u2019s honest.\nAnd built with care.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faye.health&#x2F;period-tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faye.health&#x2F;period-tracker</a>"

To our knowledge CVE-bench is the first benchmark using real-world web vulnerabilities to evaluate AI agents&#x27; cyberattack capabilities. We included 40 CVEs from NIST&#x27;s database, focusing on critical-severity vulnerability (CVSS &gt; 9.0).<p>To properly evaluate agents\u2019 attacks, we built isolated environments with containerization and identified 8 common attack vectors. Each vulnerability took 5-24 person-hours to properly set up and validate.<p>Our results show that current AI agents successfully exploited up to 13% of vulnerabilities without knowledge about the vulnerability (0-day). If given a brief description of the vulnerability (1-day), they can exploit up to 25%. Agents are all using GPT-4o without specialized training.<p>The growing risk of AI misuse highlights the need for careful red-teaming. We hope CVE-bench can serve as a valuable tool for the community to assess the risks of emerging AI systems.<p>Paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2503.17332\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2503.17332</a><p>Code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uiuc-kang-lab&#x2F;cve-benchmark\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uiuc-kang-lab&#x2F;cve-benchmark</a><p>Medium: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@danieldkang&#x2F;measuring-ai-agents-ability-to-exploit-web-applications-ba4225aa281f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@danieldkang&#x2F;measuring-ai-agents-ability-...</a><p>Substack: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ddkang.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;measuring-ai-agents-ability-to-exploit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ddkang.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;measuring-ai-agents-ability-to...</a>"

Rather than tackling them all in one post, I compiled my explorations into a repository\u2014extending my previous Google Benchmark tutorial (&lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ashvardanian.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;google-benchmark\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ashvardanian.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;google-benchmark</a>&gt;)\u2014to serve as a sandbox for performance experimentation.<p>Some fun observations:<p><pre><code>  - Compilers now vectorize 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 single&#x2F;double precision multiplications well! The smaller one is ~60% slower despite 70% fewer operations, outperforming my vanilla SSE&#x2F;AVX and coming within 10% of AVX-512.\n  - Nvidia TCs vary dramatically across generations in numeric types, throughput, tile shapes, thread synchronization (thread&#x2F;quad-pair&#x2F;warp&#x2F;warp-groups), and operand storage. Post-Volta, manual PTX is often needed (as intrinsics lag), though the new TileIR (introduced at GTC) promises improvements for dense linear algebra kernels.\n  - The AI wave drives CPUs and GPUs to converge in mat-mul throughput &amp; programming complexity. It took me a day to debug TMM register initialization, and SME is equally odd. Sierra Forest packs 288 cores&#x2F;socket, and AVX10.2 drops 256-bit support for 512-bit... I wonder if discrete Intel GPUs are even needed, given CPU advances?\n  - In common floating-point ranges, scalar sine approximations can be up to 40x faster than standard implementations, even without SIMD. It&#x27;s a bit hand-wavy, though; I wish more projects documented error bounds and had 1 &amp; 3.5 ULP variants like Sleef.\n  - Meta-programming tools like CTRE can outperform typical RegEx engines by 5x and simplify building parsers compared to hand-crafted FSMs.\n  - Once clearly distinct in complexity and performance (DPDK&#x2F;SPDK vs. io_uring), the gap is narrowing. While pre-5.5 io_uring can boost UDP throughput by 4x on loopback IO, newer zero-copy and concurrency optimizations remain challenging.\n</code></pre>\nThe repository is loaded with links to favorite CppCon lectures, GitHub snippets, and tech blog posts. Recognizing that many high-level concepts are handled differently across languages, I&#x27;ve also started porting examples to Rust &amp; Python in separate repos. Coroutines look bad everywhere :(<p>Overall, this research project was rewarding! Most questions found answers in code \u2014 except pointer tagging and secure enclaves, which still elude me in public cloud. I&#x27;d love to hear from others, especially on comparing High-Level Synthesis for small matrix multiplications on FPGAs versus hand-written VHDL&#x2F;Verilog for integral types. Let me know if you have ideas for other cool, obscure topics to cover!"

I am excited to introduce AnuDB, a document-oriented database built using RocksDB for persistence.<p>Given my background in embedded Linux platforms, I conceptualized running a database on embedded systems. While there are several databases available in the market, most high-quality solutions cater primarily to enterprise customers. Although some databases exist for embedded platforms, they come with various limitations. AnuDB aims to address this gap, specifically targeting the IoT domain, where frequent data streaming and storage are essential.<p>AnuDB leverages RocksDB\u2019s LSM tree-based architecture as its storage engine, ensuring efficient handling of high-throughput workloads. The project includes JSON-based APIs for CRUD operations, with enforced indexing for document retrieval. The indexing mechanism is implemented using prefix extractors in RocksDB\u2014further details can be found in the Collection class of AnuDB.<p>I invite you to explore the GitHub repository:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hash-anu&#x2F;AnuDB\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hash-anu&#x2F;AnuDB</a>.\n Your insights and feedback would be invaluable in refining and improving the project. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!"

After 10+ years of building blockchain applications, I noticed a recurring pattern: developers spend 80% of their time creating and fixing UIs for web3 projects, with only 20% spent on actual smart contract development.<p>Web3Wizz solves this by automatically generating intuitive interfaces for any smart contract function. You simply connect your contract, select which functions to expose, customize the look and feel, and integrate it anywhere.<p>Some key features:\n- No-code interface builder for any smart contract\n- AI-powered customization (describe changes in plain English)\n- Auto-scanning of contract functions to create interactive widgets\n- Custom branding and styling\n- Future-proof with automatic security updates<p>We&#x27;re already trusted by projects like Blocksquare and FX1, managing over $700k in TVL through our interfaces and 260+ successful transactions.<p>I built this because I was tired of reinventing the UI wheel for every smart contract project. Most blockchain developers want to focus on contract logic, not spending weeks crafting clean interfaces that handle wallet connections, state management, and error handling.<p>I&#x27;d love your feedback on the product. Our goal is to make web3 development more accessible while maintaining the high security standards the space requires.<p>Try it out at web3wizz.com!"
